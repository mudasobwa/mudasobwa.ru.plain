Wind on the mill

Nowhere over the ground
  nowhen, but who now cares…
Treating the dream as wound
  reaching rich stars on stairs,
crying for what is over, is
  meaning the sense for clown,
glowering at the gloves
  those were throwing down—
    We don't mind,
    we don't mind.
      Zounds, it's all God's Will.
    Rustle, the wind,
    stir, the wind.
      It's only the wind on the mill.
Hear the voice of widow.
  Cry on your own cemetery.
A view through the broken window
  is a sigh of our century.
Who now does the matter,
  Looking at creatures in tears!
Nowhen is over. Latter
  nobody promises and swears.

      It's only the wind on the mill.
