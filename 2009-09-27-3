Wind on the mill

Nowhere over the ground
&nbsp;&nbsp;nowhen, but who now cares…
Treating the dream as wound
&nbsp;&nbsp;reaching rich stars on stairs,
crying for what is over, is
&nbsp;&nbsp;meaning the sense for clown,
glowering at the gloves
&nbsp;&nbsp;those were throwing down—
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We don't mind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we don't mind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zounds, it's all God's Will.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rustle, the wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stir, the wind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's only the wind on the mill.
Hear the voice of widow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cry on your own cemetery.
A view through the broken window
&nbsp;&nbsp;is a sigh of our century.
Who now does the matter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at creatures in tears!
Nowhen is over. Latter
&nbsp;&nbsp;nobody promises and swears.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's only the wind on the mill.
