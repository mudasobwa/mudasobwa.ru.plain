Clown

Whether youâ€™re cutting up honeyed luscious pie  

trying to put youself in goddamn eternity,  

or dividing by nil, calculating pi  

with unlimited accuracy, reciting insanity,


you are lonesome here, forgetting superfluous words  

forgiving void in the middle of crying festival.


Thanks to the gestures, I see gleams of splashing swords  

in hands, holding crow quill to survive, to aestivate.
