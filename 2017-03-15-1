<p style="vertical-align: top;">_Nike has announced that it plans to launch a high-performance hijab for female Muslim athletes called the Nike Pro Hijab, according to the UK’s Independent.  
  
<i>CNN’s Money_ reports that the [process of designing the Pro Hijab took 13 months](http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/07/news/nike-pro-hijab/index.html), and the final product will be available for sale next spring. Nike said the hijab is already being worn by Lari.  
  
“I was thrilled and a bit emotional to see Nike prototyping a Hijab,” Lari said in a statement. “I’ve tried so many different hijabs for performance, and … so few of them actually work for me. But once I put it on and took it for a spin on the ice, I was blown away by the fit and the light weight.”
