It appears to show that the globally trending #TrumpWon began in Russia — specifically, in St. Petersburg. There's resonance to that. When Adrian Chen of the New York Times explored the world of online Russian trolls, his search brought him back to an office building in that city. The image was quickly picked up on Twitter and passed around. But there's good reason to think it's not real.

Хорошо быть журналистом американского журнала, да.
