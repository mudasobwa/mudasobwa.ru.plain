Wide-eyed with wonder, ‘Baby’ the elephant takes her first look at the world

  
    It"s scary enough taking your first steps in the world. But when a crowd is watching you, it can be even more frightening.  
    That certainly seems to be the case for this three-week-old elephant calf "Baby" making her first public appearance at Melbourne Zoo.  
    She kept very close to her mother, narrowly avoiding being trampled on as she rolled on the ground. Then, to the delight of the zoo"s visitors, she had her first dip in the water.

Там еще есть фотографии. Никто не знает, а по нашим законам — можно в хрущевке в центре Москвы держать слоненка?
