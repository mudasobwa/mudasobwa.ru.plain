откуда взялись foo и bar в программистских примерах кода

> Foo and bar come from the US Army WWII acronym FUBAR, "F-ed Up Beyond All Recognition". A whole family of these terms came into widespread use during the North African and Sicilian campaigns (1942-43). Rick Atkinson's excellent Day of Battle: The War in Sicily and Italy, 1943-1944 gives a list of these. For instance a JANFU is a "Joint Army Navy F Up", such as the incident on 11 July 1943 when the invasion fleet for Operation Husky shot down 23 Army Air Force C-47 transports carrying paratroopers to reinforce the beachhead.
