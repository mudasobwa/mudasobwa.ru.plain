Просто анекдот, из любимых

So a Texan goes to Harvard and he is walking across Harvard yard when he sees a student, wearing his beanie, approaching. He stops the student and asks, ‘Excuse me, feller, where"s the library at?’  
The Harvard student, taken aback, responds, ‘Dear sir, here at Harvard we do not end our sentences with prepositions.’  
To which the Texan replies ‘Okay, where"s the library at, asshole.’
