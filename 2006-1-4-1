TATA vs ATAT

§3 Usability crap again?

☇ p15255-1 

For the last two weeks I was accidentally finding myself debatingusability questions in hardly conceived areas. I argued for licensefee by cellular carriers, against home video sets, in favour of cowboyhats and, surprisingly, about the computer software, especiallydifferent browsers.

☇ p15255-2 

I had never won the discussion, though I have yielded the impression of understanding what actually _usability_ is. It is a little bit more, than simply a habit as I used to thing before.

☇ p15255-3 

Being using something, a person is always frustrating by someoccasional properties and enjoying others. Most of the above are noteven noticeable, but the ratio of the rest makes the whole impressionof the something. I got a point, that there are _TATA_ things fighting with _ATAT_ competitors. Intrigued?

☇ p15255-4 

_TATA_ states for “Too Annoying Too Accept”, while _ATAT_is “Attractive Truthfully And Tempting”. Operating the stuff, everybodymay record herself to plot the graph of impression during the stuffusage. Something like that:

	•   _1st second:_  Damn, how this cover opens?	
	•   _5th second:_  Wow! An object-glass is great!	
	•   _25th second:_  Where is flash gun button?	
	•   _40th second:_  Hmmm, is a focus autoadjusting here?	
	•   _50th second:_  I made a picture.

☇ p15255-5 

That's sine-like function with peaks at 1st second (for frustration) and at 5th second for childlike glee.

☇ p15255-6 

The nontrivial thing is that the other person can be recorded for absolutely other graph:

	•   _1st second:_  This cover is so pretty! That's leather! Wow!	
	•   _5th second:_  An object-glass is definitely too huge, that's inconvenient in use.	
	•   _25th second:_  Well, the flash gun button is OK.	
	•   _40th second:_  Damn, a focus adjusts automatically, that's lame!	
	•   _50th second:_  I made a picture.

☇ p15255-7 

And, amazingly enough, the graph is totally opposite to the first one.Namely, what was impressive for the person one became ebarassingfor the person two. *That means, that there is no usability axiom over. There are usability theorems in different target axiomatics.* 

☇ h15255-2 §3 So what?

☇ p15255-8 

Let us turn back to the example with new-camera-shoting above. If we gonna found a brand new company, making cameras, we are to:

	•  make the cover, the object-class and the focus autoadjustment customizeable within a line of models;	
	•  leave the flash button in the same design, but put it in other place over the camera.

☇ p15255-9 

But my point is that the written above is somehow wrong.

☇ p15255-10 

We don't actually need to think about all the emotions of the testedpersons. The flush button may easily be left intact. That's not a kingof _TATA_irritation (nor the temper as well), it's only a slight discontent.Nobody may get rid of all the reasons of discontent of allthe customers. No-bo-dy. We just need to labour at eliminating all the  _TATA_s and bringing some  _ATAT_s on the top. That's it.

☇ p15255-11 

We have to think about making a possibility to switch focus autoadjusting off (to suppress  _TATA_  feeling of the second tester) and leave the cover leathered (for improving  _ATAT_s of the first).

☇ p15255-12 

I surely oversimplified the things, but you got the point.

☇ h15255-3 §3 Does it work in software?

☇ p15255-13 

Yes, it does. More than whereever. Because the software usersare addicted to be annoyed. No other industry leaders may take noneof care about customers irritations and still sell the productsuccessfully for decades.

☇ p15255-14 

The only thing is to be taken into account while creating new software is:  _put a lot of luxury and eliminate at least critical bugs_.  More luxury – more success in business. And, unfortunately, that thesis really works.
