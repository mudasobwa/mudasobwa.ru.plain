A Customer calls a UNIX consul


    A Customer calls a UNIX consul with a question:
    

		*Customer*:			What is the command that will tell me the revision code of a program ?
		*UNIX consul*:			Yes, that's correct.
		*Customer*:			No, what is it ?
		*UNIX consul*:			Yes.
		*Customer*:			So, which is the one ?
		*UNIX consul*:			No. 'which' is used to find the program.
		*Customer*:			Stop this. Who are you ?
		*UNIX consul*:			Use 'who am i' not 'who r yoo'. You can also 'finger yoo' to get information about yoo'.
		*Customer*:			All I want to know is what finds the revision code ?
		*UNIX consul*:			Use 'what'.
		*Customer*:			That's what I am trying to find out. Isn't that true ?
		*UNIX consul*:			No. 'true' gives you 0.
		*Customer*:			Which one ?
		*UNIX consul*:			'true' gives you 0. 'which programname'
		*Customer*:			Let's get back to my problem. What program? How do I find it?
		*UNIX consul*:			Type 'find / -name it -print' to find 'it'. Type 'what program' to get the revision code.
		*Customer*:			I want to find the revision code.
		*UNIX consul*:			You can't 'find revisioncode', you must use 'what program'.
		*Customer*:			Which command will do what I need?
		*UNIX consul*:			No. 'which command' will find 'command'.
		*Customer*:			I think I understand. Let me write that.
		*UNIX consul*:			You can 'write that' only if 'that' is a user on your system.
		*Customer*:			Write what?
		*UNIX consul*:			No. 'write that'. 'what program'.
		*Customer*:			Cut that out!
		*UNIX consul*:			Yes. those are valid files for 'cut'. Don't forget the options.
		*Customer*:			Do you always do this ?
		*UNIX consul*:			'du' will give you disk usage.
		*Customer*:			HELP!
		*UNIX consul*:			'help' is only used for Source Code Control System (SCCS).
		*Customer*:			You make me angry.
		*UNIX consul*:			No, I don't 'make me' angry but I did 'make programname' when I was upset once.
		*Customer*:			I don't want to make trouble, so no more.
		*UNIX consul*:			No 'more'? 'which' will help you find 'more'. Every system has 'more'.
		*Customer*:			Nice help! I'm confused more now!
		*UNIX consul*:			Understand that since 'help' is such a small program, it is better not to 'nice help'. and 'more now' is not allowed but 'at now' is. Unless of course 'now' is a file name.
		*Customer*:			This is almost as confusing as my PC.
		*UNIX consul*:			I didn't know you needed help with 'pc'. Let me get you to the Pascal compiler tea
