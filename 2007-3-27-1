Some women may see 100 million colors, thanks to their genes


    Dr. Neitz, who conducts his research with his wife Maureen, said only women have the potential for super color vision.  
    That's because the genes for the pigments in green and red cones lie on the X chromosome, and only women have two X chromosomes, creating the opportunity for one type of red cone to be activated on one X chromosome and the other type of red cone on the other one. In a few cases, women may have two distinct green cones on either X chromosome.  
    …  
    Based on Dr. Neitz's estimates, there could be 99 million women in the world with true four-color vision.

Теперь понятно, почему женщины так любят телефоны «Nokia», жрущие дисплеями батарею, как бык — овцу.
