I am interested in job offers at positions: System Architect, Project Manager, Project Leader, Team Leader, Guru/Evangelist.

I have an experience in C/C++ pointing, SQL querying, Java threads woodoo magic (and woodoo pleasure since 6.0), Perl crypting, Javascript handling, AJAX inplacing, Python tabbing, LISP bracketing. I have been working with so many unix variants (HP-UX, Solaris, Minix, Linux) that I finally learned the proper plural form ‘unices’. I have managed the jabber client-server apps in Yandex, led warehouse management apps for US customers, developed the metamodelling tool in Berlin and created the medical apps in SPb.

§3 Just my 2¢

 	• _Problem solving approach:_ Don't reinvent the wheel. Algorithmization, automated code inspection and testing; «smart» data source choice; language and tools fixing upon the specifics of the project, and not the skills of participants and the personal predilections of managers.
 	• _Methodology:_ UML + CWM (see OMG); XP (especially Pair Programming and Iteration Planning); the mandatory use of coding standards and automated testing tools; a clear understanding of patterns and anti-patterns; version control (CVS, SourceSafe, BitKeeper , GIT); AOP (e. g. AspectJ) and Modular Application Design; Inplace QA and Hallway Usability Testing.
 	• _Effectiveness principle:_ think how to solve the meta-meta-tasks, build M3-models (see MOF). Save time.
 	• _Code optimization principle:_ ‘bootstrap’ where possible (see, for example, the Maven project). When it's impossible, redesign and bootstrap.
 	• _Early work principle:_ design, code, refactor. Repeat while (true || deadline).
 	• _Redundant functionality principle:_ create the cover and provide comments in the ‘@TODO’-style. Never sell surplus until the first release.
 	• _Commenting code:_ documentation generation (eg, JavaDoc) must be completed without error messages.
 	• _Good code principle:_ code, so that an arbitrary line is not ashamed to be shown to Kernighan and Ritchie.
 	• I used to use over twenty programming languages—from assembling language to Java, from COBOL to perl and from Shell-script to .NET. I like Java for the elegance and LISP for brackets. I learned the ABC on DVK-2 with an operating system RT11SJ, the Russian analogue (in the same sense in which the VAZ-2101 is an analogue of Fiat) of VAX/VMS. At home I am using Linux. I hate Solaris for her memory alignment. I am loyally calm regarding Windows. My favorite activity is the development of new technologies (yielding skills, if say it less stilted.)
 	• I am an originator of the  first translation (http://russian.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/1.html)   of Spolsky's “Manual on UI design for programmers”. If I am not thinking about IT, I probably may be seen writing poems of average quality, or playing bridge with my friends.
