Once again about the Deuce

I begged their pardons, and their, and their,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;however I couldn’t fall asleep.  

My deuce came to me and straddled a chair,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;prepared himself to leap.  

Unceremoniously he urged me “Well,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;it’s time for contracts to sign.  

Let’s assent to the league, let’s strike the bells,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;let’s tresspass sine die, time’s thine.”  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You are free to lie, and to fornicate  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to betray you friends, break your words.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, you’ll be oblidged later to meet a cheque,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s all to be afterwards.”  
  

“You’ll get to know that: sins are tall,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;turning bitterly gray and dun.  

The fortune is not being one for all,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;but everybody to be as one.”  

“You’ll comprehend the point: you are not judged,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;neither then, nor straight away.  

All together to waggle ‘yes’ to fudge,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;all and sundry to nod ‘no way’.”  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You’ll engender wolfs, make them clearance check,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teach them wag their tails for lords.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, you’ll be oblidged later to meet a cheque,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s all to be afterwards.”  
  

“The snows of yesteryear, your soul isn’t a cage  

&nbsp;&nbsp;lo and behold!&nbsp;— Doomsday’s gonna pass.  

In our Stone Age, in our Nuclear Age,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;elastic conscience costs a vast.”  

“No need nowadays to be good, it’s a pain  

&nbsp;&nbsp;closing our days in the ash...  

So shoulder a debt, take this fountain pen,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;and sign it here, under a dash!”  
  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deuce unconstrainedly rised from a mud  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and pushed a vial to me cross a desk.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I uttered “Surely it is a blood?”&nbsp;—  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Just an ink,”&nbsp;— he equivocal blessed.
