Клопп о мотивации

> Klopp is bitterly disappointed Wolfsburg winger Draxler has taken a mega offer from Paris Saint-Germain, and says: “We believe that if someone needs to be convinced by money, then at one point—when you really need character—you will not get it.  
“Players should know they can earn really serious money here, reasonable money here, but we will not go nuts. We want to convince players about the special character of the club.  
“Nobody has to leave Liverpool because of money. Maybe there are a few clubs in world football who can play better and if you can go there, these few clubs, yeah then do it.  
“But for all the rest this should be the best place to be. I may have rose-tinted glasses but I would say at the moment that LFC is a really good place to be for a player to develop.  
“I can say we don’t want to convince players with money. We want to convince them with the way we go.
